[x] Play different sounds when get collectables in the phase
[] Reduce Plataform quantities by the collectables items existance
[] At a new phase, replace the platform challenges randomly
[] Online multi players aspects
[] Ranking
[] Start to thinking about the leveling turning more difficult the game
[] Menu to select character
[] Think some actions for character not just jump everywhere
[] Some other challenges in the field, like not collectable that if touched finish the game or drain life (if this way, is necessary to define Life System and collectables to increase refill it)
[] Create a button on the screen to reset phase and clean points
[] BUG: After some new phases my character stopped to jump
[] BUG: When I have a platform that is a little more high of my character, the game don't allow the sprite to pass under of it and some collectable turn impossible to get
